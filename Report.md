# Introduction
Technology has been shaping medicine and healthcare for decades, and yet continues to do so at a rapid pace. Deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) is one innovation set to revolutionize the medical industry and aid in bringing reliable and affordable healthcare to everyone. This report seeks to investigate and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, discuss ethical implications in the field and provide projections of growth of the innovation for the next decade.
## 1. Strengths of Deep Learning in Pathology Applications
Before the advent of deep learning, an image analysis method known as feature engineering was used where pathology experts are needed to encode features relevant to the diagnostic process. Deep learning is more efficient than feature engineering as the it learns relevant features directly from the training process, builds upon its knowledge with every iteration, and need of pathology knowledge for the AI engineer is reduced. It also takes less time to implement.5 (Steiner, D.F. et al, 2021)

Histopathology often relies on recognition of patterns in data such as slide images (see Figure 2.1), scans etc. by the physician. However, reproducibility of manual diagnosis (similar results achieved between two different physicians) has been found lacking. Thus, the use of deep learning AI could be standardized in pathology and increase reliability of a diagnosis.3 (van der Laak et al, 2021)
In recent years, a decrease in pathologists has been observed, with a reduction of 20% predicted over the next 20 years due to an aging workforce and less trainees taking up the field. Due to this, AI solutions that help automate the clinical workflow of pathologists are, and will remain, in high demand.5 (Brush K., 2021)

## 2. Limitations
The biggest limitation when it comes to developing deep learning AI is training the AI. Training deep learning systems requires massive amounts of labelled and structured data, to develop accurate predictive models that are acceptable for clinical use and evaluate and test it extensively. Big data analytics can provide sufficient data, but this data is generally unstructured. Deep learning models can only work on unlabelled data once trained but cannot be trained on it.5 (Brush, K.2021)

## 3. Ethical Implications
Although deep learning AI is beneficial in healthcare, it still has significant ethical and moral disadvantages. Issues such as patient privacy as well as patient safety, and race and gender inequalities are evident with its rising use. Thus, the development of such technologies must be governed by governing bodies consisting of domain-related professionals such as pathologists, AI researchers, clinicians and even the patients themselves.6 (Chauhan, C. and Gullapalli, R.R., 2021)

## 4. Evidence-based Projections
### 4.1 Short Term (1-2 years)
In the short term, AI can be used only to automate very basic yet time consuming and routine tasks. The deep learning AI of today cannot use or intuition or extensive clinical experience like a human pathologist but can identify patterns in given data by learning from massive datasets.7 (Bajwa, J. et al, 2021) Approval of deep learning AI systems and integration into clinical workflow is at just the start of its potential.
### 4.2 Medium Term (2-5 years)
In a study by Frost and Sullivan (2021), deep learning AI systems are predicted to be in use for supporting clinical decisions and automating workflow logistics in hospitals by 2025. In developing countries that have high patient populations who do not have proper access to pathologists, the use of AI systems is expected to help with the shortage of qualified professionals and increase access to quality reliable healthcare for all.8 (Anon, 2021)
### 4.3 Long Term (5-10 years)
With innovation in the field of cloud computing and big data, availability of data will enhance development of advanced deep learning systems.6 (Brush.K, 2021) While as per Figure 4.1, deep learning AI-enabled image analysis will reach a plateau of productivity in 5-10 years’ time, fields in the rising medical industry that it contributes to, such as precision health, are expected remain relevant for more than 10 years from now.

# Conclusion
In this report, I have introduced the reader to deep learning AI and its applications in pathology, enumerated the advantages and disadvantages of this technology as well as its ethical implications. Projections for short and long term future of deep learning in pathology have also been provided.
Investing in deep learning AI development for pathological applications will aid in bringing life-saving technologies to life. It has the potential to positively impact medical infrastructure and access to healthcare in developing nations. Despite the current scenario of its implementation being primitive, advanced ways to build upon its strengths are expected to make an impact in the next decade and it must be emphasized that now is the best time for an investment in this field.
Based on the above evidence, I therefore recommend that you invest in deep learning AI to develop this innovation that will become an essential tool in medicine.
